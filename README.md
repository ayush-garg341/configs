- Common errors face while installing YCM with vim
    - Default installed vim not compiled with python3 support.
    - Solution
        - brew install vim
    - Now this vim is compiled with python3 support, but we have to replace or create an alias for it.
        - Alias vim to this new vim location.
        - ex: **alias vim='/opt/homebrew/Cellar/vim/9.0.2050/bin/vim'**
    - Once we have **ycm** package inside ~/.config/nvim/autoload/plugged/
        - cd into that directory
        - brew install make cmake go nodejs java
        - Now if we run install.py script with default python that comes pre-installed, we will get another issue of **headers missing**.
        - The solution of above problem is, use new python binary which got installed when we installed vim using brew.
        - To check default location of python -> which python3
        - For brew installed python, check the location of binary, in my case **/opt/homebrew/bin/python3.12 install.py --all** inside ycm folder.
        - Still when we open python, go files using nvim we don;t get autocomplete.
            - To fix this issue :- **pip3 install pynvim** in global python and virtual python folder.
